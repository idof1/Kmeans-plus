This project implements the K-Means++ algorithm to initialize centroids for K-means clustering. The implementation is split into Python and C components, where the Python part handles the K-Means++ initialization, and the C extension handles the main K-means clustering algorithm. This project also integrates the K-means implementation from HW1.
